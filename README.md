Here is the CSCPay exploit

   
Hacking the CSCPay laundry machine This is more of an exploit than a hack.
It is zero day and can be used right now. 
Its so simple a teenager can use it with only a basic knowledge of ANDROID operating system.
It allows one to do free laundry at ANY machine worldwide that uses the CSCPay laundry card readers with Bluetooth abilities.
This hack only requires that the CSCPay app has been previously installed, and has been to a laundry room where it intended to be used and has the location set.
It is very important for this to work from now on the CSCPay app must never be allowed to hook up to the Internet from this point forward.
It should have the internet access removed in permissions if possible This is the tried and tested method.
First NEVER open the app if your phone can connect to the internet either thru Service, Bluetooth tethering or WiFi.
It is best used with All three shut off and airplane mode on. No turn ON your Bluetooth. 
Make sure it is only on for pairing with devices and not to connect to the internet. 
This is assuming you have a 5 dollar balance of the free money CSCPay grants all first time user.
If there is no money on the app this will not work. You may have to put a few dollars on the app first. 
Go to the target machine with all data cut off including provider service.
It will give you a warning about lack of being able to connect to the internet...ignore Hit the scan a machine button.
Scan the bar code in question on the target machine. 
It says now connecting to a machine, then connected.
Set up your desired setting on the machine, ie. drying time or hot or cold water.
After it is set to your specs hit start this machine.
This is all in the timing now..... It will say the cost to use this machine is xxxx you are now about to pay xxxx (no i'm not) do you wish to start this machine? Yes.
The laundry machine you should have one hand on your phone and the other on the green start button on target machine. 
Press the yes on your phone, as soon as the laundry says start and beeps press the green start button now as fast as possible go ahead and hit the square navigation button on android and close out the app.
Wait at least 1 minute before opening the app again.
Open the app again and you will see your balance is still the same. 
Repeat on as many machines as needed.
As long as you never click on that app with your phone being in a disconnected state it will not deduct the funds If you ever do accidentally turn on the app and it connects to the internet your gonna find it in a negative balance for every load ever done in this method.
You can not clear the data or you will not have the needed start balance to do laundry. 
The only possible other Hack which I came up with but never implemented involved copying the app with a balance, then do the procedure and uninstall and then reinstall cloned app. 
This will probably work better as if ever accidentally connected to the WWW it will not have a negative balance.
I never bothered as I have several phones that are only Wi-Fi connected only phones and why go thru that trouble if this works.
Im sure this will be patched or fixed at some point. 
This method has worked for ten months now, a secret never told remains a secret.
Today I am making my secret available to all you who need some help with free laundry.
I did try on several occasions to contact CSCPay cooperate here in the USA and the app developer to see about a bug bounty. 
They never contacted me, meaning they either didnt take me seriously or security is not a priority.
