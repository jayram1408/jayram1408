- 👋 Hi, I’m @jayram1408 my Real name is Jason
- 👀 I’m interested in software development from a leadership prospective.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too management roles for running large projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an idea I have for Pi cryptocurrency
- 📫 How to reach me ...jayram1408@gmail.com or jayram1408@hotmail.com

     I have a idea for a ticket that will go on any and all apps that will 
     Have anything to do with Pi cryptocurrency. This is a brief summary.
     This would be a small ticker kind of like a battery meter or the time 
     stamp on your phone. This would be real time and be required on all Pi
     applications like how Google has certain requirements to develop
     Android software. It would display the current value of Pi against
     the US dollar and when ticked or the button pushed, it would then be 
     able to show history values and a nice feature, would show block chain
     creation VS. this value. Just so everyone knows the value of what they have.
     It would have some features like being able to enter the Pi amount in a
     currency calculator zto get real world time value and also historical. 
     I have minimal software development skills so I am looking for a lot 
     Help with this project. But if implemented, it would be required on all
     Pi apps so there is the potential for advertising profits. I plan to have
     Any all all collaborators who help in the beginning stages have a shared,
     vested interest in the project going forward on. This will be reward for 
     those helping in the early stages when there's not a lot of profit in the
     near foreseeable future these are the ones willing to do the hard work and
 stick it out for the profit gains in the end.
